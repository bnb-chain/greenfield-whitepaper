# 2. Assumptions

The biggest assumption for the design is:

***Greenfield is an economically sustainable, service-oriented
ecosystem.***

By "self-sustained", it means that the service providers and
corresponding service consumers of Greenfield are rational; they
complement each other. The providers and the blockchain validators will
get paid a fair amount for the service they supply, while the users are
willing to pay for the service they use.

By "service-oriented", it means that the value was created in Greenfield
by providing service to the users of the ecosystem. It doesn't have
built-in value by itself.

The implicit assumption underlying these two traits is that the majority
of the providers and blockchain validators are reasonable entities and
individuals. They will not do evil given the profit they earn is larger
than the fortune they can plunder.

This is a self-justifiable trust for the whole ecosystem to exist: if a
substantial percentage of providers and blockchain validators do evil
and the ecosystem cannot heal itself by ruling out these malicious
players, the whole ecosystem will not be used and have no value to
existing. If that happens, nobody wins even for a short time.

With this implicit built-in trust assumed, many designs are simplified
as described in the below sections.

Another assumption is that both the service provider and consumer sides
would expect the actual "service contracts" between the two to allow
limited liability and provide exit options, even if the contracts are
carried out mostly by code. In consumers' interest, they do not want to
pay a large size of fund upfront and would like to choose a better
provider within the ecosystems or even outside whenever they want. On
the other side, in the service providers' interest, they do not want to
become a data wasteyard or help circulate any content against their own
principles.

The payment, data availability check, and a few other key features are
designed based on this assumption.

The last big assumption is that data has value and users will want to
extract this value with smart contract automation, privacy, and
transparency. This results in the considerable design for cross-chain
between BNB Greenfield and BNB Smart Chain (BSC). This should be the
most important assumption and hopefully close to the truth.
