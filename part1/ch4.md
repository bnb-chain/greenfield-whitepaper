# 4 BNB Greenfield Core

## 4.1 The BNB Greenfield Blockchain

BNB Greenfield blockchain uses Proof-of-Stake based on
Tendermint-consensus for its own network security. Blocks are created
every 2 seconds on the Greenfield chain by a group of validators.

BNB will be the gas and governance token on this blockchain. There is a
native cross-chain bridge between the Greenfield blockchain and BSC. The
initial BNB will be locked on BSC and re-minted on Greenfield. BNB and
data operation primitives can flow between Greenfield and BSC.

Total circulation of BNB will stay unchanged as it is now but flow among
BNB Beacon Chain, BSC, and Greenfield.

The validator election and governance are based on a proposal-vote
mechanism, which is revised based on Cosmos SDK's governance module:
anyone can create and propose to become a validator, and the election
into the active set will be based on the stake ranking (initially new
validators may request the existing validator set's votes to be
qualified for election). As validators will host all the critical
metadata and respond to all data operation transactions, they should run
professionally in terms of performance and stability.

To facilitate cross-chain operation and convenient asset management, the
address format of the Greenfield blockchain will be fully compatible
with BSC (and Ethereum). It also accepts EIP712 transaction signing and
verification. These enable the existing wallet infrastructure to
interact with Greenfield at the beginning naturally.

## 4.2 The Storage Providers, SPs

SPs play a different role from Greenfield validators, although the same
organizations or individuals can run both SPs and validators if they
follow all the rules and procedures to get elected.

SPs store the objects' real data, i.e. the payload data. Each SP runs
its own object storage system. Similar to Amazon S3 and other object
store systems, the objects stored on SPs are immutable. The users may
delete and re-create the object, but they cannot modify it.

SPs have to register themselves first by depositing on the Greenfield
blockchain as their "Service Stake". Greenfield validators will go
through a dedicated governance procedure to vote for the SPs of their
election. SPs are encouraged to advertise their information and prove to
the community their capability, as SPs have to provide a professional
storage system with high-quality SLA.

SPs provide publicly accessible APIs for users to upload, download, and
manage data. These APIs are very similar to Amazon S3 APIs so that
existing developers may feel familiar enough to write code for it.
Meanwhile, they provide each other REST APIs and form another
white-listed P2P network to communicate with each other to ensure data
availability and redundancy. There will also be a P2P-based
upload/download network across SPs and user-end client software to
facilitate easy connections and fast data download, which is similar to
BitTorrent.

More SPs are welcome to ensure decentralization and data redundancy. But
too many SPs may make SPs unable to make enough to sustain the business.
Greenfield has an incentive design to make a proper number of SPs
available. While SPs can choose to stay with the network or leave.

When the SPs join and leave the network, they have to follow a series of
actions to ensure data redundancy for the users; otherwise, their
"Service Stake" will be fined. This is achieved through the data
availability challenge (described in detail in Part 3) and validator
governance votes.

## 4.3 The Pair Synergy

Greenfield validators and SPs form a pair synergy to provide the whole
storage service. Validators store the metadata and financial ledger with
consensus, while SPs provide real data storage and downloading.
Validators have the motivation to ensure enough good SPs to provide
decent service, while users and SPs rely on a stable and decentralized
Greenfield blockchain as a single source of truth on metadata.
