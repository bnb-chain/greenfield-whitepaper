# 8 "Not" Ending for the Design

Many details are not covered in Part 1. While some topics will be added
and expanded in Part 3, some are very strategic items that shoot too far
for the team to consider now.

For example, the "execute" trait of a data object. That concept points
out that some data are runnable programs. Greenfield may create a more
transparent computing environment. Users are comfortable using or
devoting their data to particular programs stored on Greenfield because
they can verify the program, they do not have to worry about the program
may change after their confirmation, and they know the program can only
run with their data in a trustful environment provided by Greenfield.

This particular function, together with other new features will be
researched and studied with the future development of BNB Greenfield.
